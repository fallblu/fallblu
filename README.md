# James Mallette 

Hi! I'm James, a CS and Mathematics student at Oxford College of Emory University.

I'm still very much getting a handle on things but one day I'd like to do research on machine learning.

I'm currently learning Python as well as HTML, CSS, and JS and will soon start learning Django
